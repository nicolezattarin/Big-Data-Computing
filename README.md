# Big Data Computing with Spark

# Installation 
To install pyspark on your local machine, please refer to the [official installation guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/installation.html) or [specific python instructions](http://www.dei.unipd.it/~capri/BDC/PythonInstructions.html).

# Overview
### Basic example: word count
We provide a basic example of word count in Spark: given a text file and a fixed number of partitions, we implement different algorithms to count the number of words in the text file. See the [README](https://github.com/nicolezattarin/Big-Data-Computing/tree/main/word_count) for a more detailed description of the example.
